# Usage (With Upgraded)

    - Environment Variable

        - API_URL

          Network URL. For different networks, it should be the specific url for the networks.
          Mumbai: https://polygon-mumbai.g.alchemy.com/v2/B_OwiBiK0aenS3ooAxCMR9w45G1-gQ6Q

        - PRIVATE_KEY

          The private key of the owner address. You could export from the metamask.
          Note: When you deploy the sure-token, the address will be the Super-Admin who get the initial sure-token. You should **NOT** commit the Super-Admin private key to the git!!

        - SCAN_KEY

          The api key of the scan (EtherScan, PolygonScan...).
          After deploy the contract, it should verify the contract and the user could access the contrat by the Scan website.

        - SURE_TOKEN_ADDRESS

          The sure token address. It will be generated after executing deploySureToken.js. You don't have to set the variable before that.

        - PROXY_ADDRESS

          The proxy address. It will be generated after executing deployProxy.js. You don't have to set the variable before that. And it should not be updated when upgrading the new contract.

          Note: If the redeploy the proxy, it'll clear all data in the proxy.

        - UPGRADING_CONTRACT

          The new contrat name which you want to upgrade. It will use the varialbe when executing upgradeProxy.js. You don't have to set the variable before that.

                   Proxy Contract: 0xb73Cc06D...
          Implementation Contract: 0xD8Ea726a...
